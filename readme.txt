a vertical rating system that can rate AUTHORS / posts / pages & more
== Description ==

This VERTICAL rating system will rate AUTHORS while it displays ratings bars,images and items in a top to bottom fashion next to your posts instead of the usual horizontal stars.

Built with ajax the vertical rater rating system is geared towards a more fun and different layout and comes in many flavors. Use stars, hearts, towers, thermometers, arrows or anything else.
Display rating blocks automatically left or right of your post content.

Want to include your own images as a rating bar ? Simply follow instructions in the admin-panel and we may even include your transparant .png in our next version.
